    "**Detailed Explanation of the Task Solution:**\n",
    "1. Initial URL Fetching:\n",
    "   Start with a set of initial URLs for each company. \n",
    "   Fetch the HTML content of each initial URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Parsing HTML Content:\n",
    "    Parse the fetched HTML content using a tool like BeautifulSoup to extract text from elements where data is availeble(be sure that not styles or    scripts) and links.\n",
    "    Store the text and links from the parsed content.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. Recursively Follow Links:\n",
    "    For each link extracted from the initial page, fetch the HTML content of the linked page.\n",
    "    Parse the linked page's content to extract further text and links.\n",
    "    Repeat this process for each new link found, until you reach a specified depth or a maximum number of links.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. Maximum Fetching Control:\n",
    "    Implement a counter or limit to control how deep the search goes. This prevents infinite recursion and ensures the search stops after a reasonable number of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Data Collection:\n",
    "    Collect and store relevant data (e.g., text content, links) from each page visited.\n",
    "    Ensure that you are not revisiting the same pages by maintaining a cache of visited URLs.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Data Analysis:\n",
    "   In order to understand related information NLP with spaCy is used.\n",
    "   There are basically 2 methods defined. Both of them, almost gives same output(information).\n",
    "   While one method is using predefined model for natural language processing, the other one is using spacy component which is defined with patterns(matcher).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Display Results:\n",
    "   Show the results achieved by using any method with websites, to check by hand."

Working in a canvas environment offers many advantages including live collaboration, an expansive visual interface, and a progressive computation engine.

We’ll go through a couple of our core operators, why Python is such a crucial part of our software solution, and how we augmented our offerings with a user operator interface.

    "**Ideas of How to Improve Solution:**\n",
    "1. Instead of starting the process from the main website, it might be more beneficial to start from where the information is located. Alternatively, knowing the sites where the information is available in advance and providing these will send more relevant texts to the analysis phase.\n",
    "2. Instead of the website, if available, their databases or financial reports can be checked. Here, processing more useful information, i.e., texts, will yield more detailed results.\n",
    "3. More currencies can be added, to better understand the equity check size.\n",
    "4. If the number of search words for each URL entered is kept in a token list, and as the process goes deeper, if the URLs fall below a certain number of words in a recursive way, that is, if the URLs no longer contain money and the information being sought, but only the name of the company or something similar, irrelevant searches can be avoided by stopping the processing of the page according to the number of these words. By thinking of it like a tree, going lower in this branch can be stopped. This can provide a better search.\n",
    "5. If the data analysis part is better, it will give more accurate results. It might understand negative sentences positively and answer 'Yes' to the investment question. For example: 'While Company A has no investment in solar parks, it has a $100 million investment in wind energy.'"
